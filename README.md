# TicTacYou
hello my friends, with the good wishes for you i want to present my First game with the help of JS, CSS and HTML, a "TicTacToe". It took me a lot of days to build this game but if i mention the total hour i invested on this game then it might be 12 to 13 hours. hope you enjoy playing this game!
